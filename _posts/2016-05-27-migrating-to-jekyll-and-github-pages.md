**Welcome to my new blog, currently built with [Jekyll] and hosted on [GitHub Pages].**

I haven't written much on my blog since I started in 2011, but I want to write more. Part of why I haven't written more is because my previous host [Wordpress.com] was not offering me the flexibility that I felt was necessary when writing a technical blog. Also, I much prefer to use [Git] for managing my versions, which [Wordpress.com] did not have.

Don't get me wrong, I think [Wordpress.com] is an excellent product, but like any good product, there are competitors that provide a similar product that accommodates to a different audience. I can't say I spent a lot of time researching, but when I came across [Jekyll] and [GitHub Pages], I felt comfortable ending my search.

**This is why I am now using [Jekyll] and [GitHub Pages]:**

- [Jekyll]'s documentation made sense, and I feel confident I can design and improve the site with minimal effort.
- [GitHub Pages] makes it easy to host and publish content, since it's just a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cowboygneox/cowboygneox.github.io)
- [Jekyll] allows me to work in [Markdown], which is my language of choice for technical documentation. I will have a far easier time writing code snippets than I did on [Wordpress.com].

I hope to improve the site as a whole as I go, but right now, it's more important to me that it's easy to write. I'm excited to get to it, so stay tuned for more random programming rants and technical epiphanies.
