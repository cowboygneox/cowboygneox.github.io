**Welcome to my new blog, currently built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).**

I haven't written much on my blog since I started in 2011, but I want to write more. Part of why I haven't written more is because my previous host [Wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/) was not offering me the flexibility that I felt was necessary when writing a technical blog. Also, I much prefer to use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for managing my versions, which [Wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/) did not have.

Don't get me wrong, I think [Wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/) is an excellent product, but like any good product, there are competitors that provide a similar product that accommodates to a different audience. I can't say I spent a lot of time researching, but when I came across [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), I felt comfortable ending my search.

**This is why I am now using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/):**

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)'s documentation made sense, and I feel confident I can design and improve the site with minimal effort.
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) makes it easy to host and publish content, since it's just a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cowboygneox/cowboygneox.github.io)
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) allows me to work in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), which is my language of choice for technical documentation. I will have a far easier time writing code snippets than I did on [Wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/).

I hope to improve the site as a whole as I go, but right now, it's more important to me that it's easy to write. I'm excited to get to it, so stay tuned for more random programming rants and technical epiphanies.
